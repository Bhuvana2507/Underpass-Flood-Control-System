# 🚧 Underpass Flood Monitoring System

A smart system to prevent accidents and manage flood water in urban underpasses using water level sensors, servo motor-controlled gates, and water pump automation.

---

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project detects water accumulation in underpasses and automatically:

- **Closes the entry gate** via servo motor when water level exceeds safe limits.
- **Activates a pump** to remove water from the underpass.
- **Uses LED indicators** to signal safe (green) or unsafe (red) conditions.

The system is controlled by an **Arduino Uno**, making it simple, cost-effective, and reliable for real-world deployment.

## 🚦 Working of the System

The system continuously monitors the water level in the underpass using an analog water level sensor.

### ✅ Normal Condition (Water level > 950)
- Green LED turns **ON**
- Red LED is **OFF**
- Entry gate is **OPEN**
- Pump is **OFF**
- Vehicles can pass safely

### 🚨 Flood Condition (Water level < 550)
- Red LED turns **ON**
- Green LED is **OFF**
- Entry gate is **CLOSED** using the servo motor
- Pump is **turned ON** to remove water
- Vehicles are blocked from entering

> The gate will only open again once the water level rises back above the threshold.
